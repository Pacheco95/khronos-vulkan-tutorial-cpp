# Linux ‚ùò Setup ‚ùò Instance

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- Replaced all `VkType` to `vk::Type`. All C structs and enums will be replaced to their counterpart under `vk`
  namespace.
- We'll not set the `sType` for structs anymore. `Vulkan-Hpp` does this for us in a typesafe way.
- Replaced the deprecated `VK_MAKE_VERSION` macro to `VK_MAKE_API_VERSION`. Pay attention to the first new parameter.
- There's no need to use list initialization anymore since all types have default constructors.
  `VkApplicationInfo appInfo{};` becomes `vk::ApplicationInfo appInfo;`
- On some occasions, I'll use the type constructor to reduce lines of code like this:

  ```c++
  // Note the first parameter initialization with the default using with list initialization syntax
  // See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/list_initialization
  vk::InstanceCreateInfo createInfo({}, &appInfo);

  // Instead of
  vk::InstanceCreateInfo createInfo;
  createInfo.pApplicationInfo = &appInfo;
  ```

  I advise you to take this approach very carefully since, in some cases, it can reduce the code legibility a lot.
- I will also use the fluent initialization of objects like this:
  ```c++
  auto appInfo =
      vk::ApplicationInfo()
          .setPApplicationName(Config::APP_NAME)
          .setApplicationVersion(VK_MAKE_API_VERSION(0, 1, 0, 0))
          .setPEngineName("No Engine")
          .setEngineVersion(VK_MAKE_API_VERSION(0, 1, 0, 0))
          .setApiVersion(VK_API_VERSION_1_0);
  ```
  It makes the code easier to read and avoid setting attributes on wrong objects.
- Vulkan-Hpp has exceptions enabled by default.
  So, there is no need to check the results of **most** function calls that returns a `vk::Result`.
  See https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp#return-values-error-codes--exceptions.
- In Vulkan-Hpp, cleanup is done using the respective object's `destroy()` method.
- As you can see, there is no `m_window.destroy()` method in `cleanup()` for two reasons:
    1. `m_window` is an instance of our custom `Window` class and there's no such method.
    2. In C++ member variables are cleaned up using the first in, last out, aka. stack algorithm. And since `m_window`
       is the first declared class variable, it will be the last to clean up.
