# C++ Khronos Tutorial for Linux

Reimplementation for Linux of the original
[C tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html)
using the [Vulkan-Hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) binding.

This branch contains all the commits.
Everytime a new chapter is implemented, it is merged here.
You can check the implementation until a given step using the table of contents below.
Each branch contains navigation links for previous/next steps and also a useful link to check the git diff between last
and current step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a bug was found during the development of the current branch, the fix **will not be applied to previous branches**.
> Instead, the next branch that fixes the bug will have a bugfix notice (üêû) in the table of contents below.

> [!CAUTION]
> A critical bug was found in
> the [Loading models](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux/07-loading-models) step.
> It was caused in a very early commit, and you should fix it as soon as possible, otherwise the application will
> probably pick the wrong physical device.
> If you don't fix this bug early, then it may hinder your experience through the tutorial until you reach the chapter
> where the bug was fixed.
> This step also fixes another bug forcing application to crash on window resize.
