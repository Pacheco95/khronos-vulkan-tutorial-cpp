# Linux ‚ùò Drawing ‚ùò Rendering and presentation

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- Created `NO_TIMEOUT` constant to represent disabled timeouts and avoid magic numbers.
- Used the enhanced `Vulkan-Hpp` functions to automatically handle error results.
  You can see that our version of `Application::createSyncObjects()` is way simpler than the original.
  This works for us because we didn't set defined the `VULKAN_HPP_DISABLE_ENHANCED_MODE` macro.
  If we did this, we would have to check the results by ourselves.
