# C++ Khronos Tutorial for Linux

Reimplementation for Linux of the original
[C tutorial](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html)
using the [Vulkan-Hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) binding.

This branch contains all the commits.
Everytime a new chapter is implemented, it is merged here.
You can check the implementation until a given step using the table of contents below.
Each branch contains navigation links for previous/next steps and also a useful link to check the git diff between last
and current step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a bug was found during the development of the current branch, the fix **will not be applied to previous branches**.
> Instead, the next branch that fixes the bug will have a bugfix notice (🐞) in the table of contents below.
