# Linux ‚ùò Graphics pipeline basics ‚ùò Shader modules

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- Moved all shader compilation related code to a separate [CMakeLists.txt](res/shaders/CMakeLists.txt).
  This configuration compiles the shaders automatically only if not already compiled or the source code was changed.
  It will generate the respective `.spv` bytecodes in the same **source directory**.
  Since these `.spv` files can be generated at anytime, we will ignore them at `.gitignore`.
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Be sure to set the working directory to the project root directory to correctly load the shaders
- Created a `BinaryLoader` class to read our compiled `.spv` shader bytecodes.
- Added `[spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)` as a dependency to help us log useful information during
  development phase.
  `spdlog` also brings `[fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)` as a transitive dependency
  which is very handy for handling string interpolation.
- Also added some code at `main.cpp` to configure the logger based on `SPDLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL` compiler definition.
  `SPDLOG_ACTIVE_LEVEL` is set to `warning` in release builds.
