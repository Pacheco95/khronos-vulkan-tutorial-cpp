# Linux ‚ùò Drawing ‚ùò Swap chain recreation

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

We did a couple changes in this step:

- Moved all new GLFW calls to our `Window` class and passed a lambda function to `Window::create()` as a callback
  handler for resizes.
- Used `glfwGetWindowAttrib(m_window, GLFW_ICONIFIED) == GLFW_TRUE` instead of calling `glfwGetFramebufferSize()` to
  check if the window is minimized.
- Skip the `renderFrame()` function call instead of "pausing" the game loop.
  I did this because you probably will extend the code in the future to do other things in the main loop that should
  happen even if the window is minimized.
- Again, we used `vk::resultCheck(res, errorMessage)` to handle errors instead of manually checking the error enum and
  throwing exceptions.
