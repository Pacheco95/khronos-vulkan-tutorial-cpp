# Linux ‚ùò Presentation ‚ùò Image Views

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- `ImageViewCreateInfo::setComponents()` already set all RGBA members to `vk::ComponentSwizzle::eIdentity`, so, there's
  no need to be redundant here.
- Changed `m_swapChainImageViews.resize()` to `m_swapChainImageViews.reserve()` at `createImageViews()` since `resize()`
  instantiates new elements.
  Thus, we need to use `vector::push_back` or `vector::emplace_back` instead of indexed assignment.
  See https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/resize/
- Reordered `Application::getSuitableImageCount()` to match `Application.hpp` declaration order.
