# Linux ‚ùò Graphics pipeline basics ‚ùò Render passes

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- Used `Vulkan-hpp` helper methods to set count/pointer functions.
  Instead of using
  ```c++
  info.setColorAttachmentCount(count)
      .setPColorAttachment(&attachment)
  ```
  We use
  ```c++
  info.setColorAttachments(attachment)
  ```
  It will automatically cast attachment to a single element container if attachment was not already a container.
