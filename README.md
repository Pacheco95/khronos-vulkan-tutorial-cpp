# Linux ‚ùò Setup ‚ùò Logical device and queues

Summary [here](https://github.com/Pacheco95/khronos-vulkan-tutorial-cpp/tree/linux-summary).

# Adjustments

- We did not set up device-specific validation layers because it was deprecated a long time ago, and the documentation
  states:
  > [At the time of deprecation there were no known device-only layers and no compelling reason to create one.](
  > https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/chap46.html#extendingvulkan-layers-devicelayerdeprecation)
